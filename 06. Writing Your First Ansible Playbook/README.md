Your supervisor has asked you to find a way to automate and audit basic system configuration for new servers in your environment. Given that Ansible is already configured at a basic level in your environment, the simplest solution would be to just write a playbook for bootstrapping your new hosts. Create a playbook called  `/home/ansible/bootstrap.yml`  to fulfill the following boot strap requirements:

All servers:

* Edit  `/etc/hosts`  to include the following entry:
    
   ```
  ansible.xyzcorp.com  169.168.0.1
  ```
    
* Install  `elinks`
* Create the user  `xyzcorp_audit`
* Copy the files  `/home/ansible/motd`  and  `/home/ansible/issue`  to  `/etc/`

Network servers:

* Install  `nmap-ncat`
* Create the user  `xyzcorp_network`

SysAdmin servers:

* Copy  `/home/ansible/scripts.tgz`  from the control node to  `/mnt/storage`

The Ansible control node has been configured for you and each testing server has already been configured for use with Ansible. The default inventory has been configured to include a the groups network and sysadmin. Each group includes a sample host.
